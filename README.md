# Analyzing the Salary by Job Title and Country - Python Portfolio Project CodeCademy
## Project Overview:
This project explores demographic trends, gender dynamics, educational landscapes and global representation in a dataset on salaries. It delves into salary analysis, investigates the correlation between experience and salary, and examines race, ethnicity, and geographical variations. Additionally, the study explores age-education correlations, salary disparities among ethnicities and gender-based education levels. The analysis identifies common job titles, explores age distributions by gender, and concludes with a focus on seniority levels and gender distribution across different seniority levels.

The project code and results are contained in the Jupyter Notebook SalaryPortfolioProject.ipynb , with a summary of the conclusions below.

### In conclusion the analysis of the salary dataset has provided valuable insights into various aspects of compensation and demographic patterns. Key findings include:
The salary dataset analysis reveals key insights: an average age of 33 years with 8 years of experience, a balanced gender ratio, prevalent education level 1, global representation from five countries and an average salary of $115,307. Strong correlations exist between experience and salary (0.81) and age and salary (0.73). Job titles like Software Engineer dominate and males are more represented across different seniority levels. 


# Analyze an AB Test with Python 

## Overview:
In this project, we using Python to analyze the effectiveness of two different ad campaigns, commonly known as an A/B test. The focus is on determining whether a new version (version B) outperforms the original (version A) in terms of click-through rates and understanding how ad effectiveness varies across different dimensions.
## Tasks:
1. Import, Inspect, and Merge.
2. Calculate Click-Through Rate.
3. Compare Ad Performances by Social Media Platform.
4. Compare Ad Performances by Tech Device
5. Weekday and Weekend Performance by Device Type.
## The project serves as a practical tutorial for learning Python for data science through a hands-on approach to real-world data analysis...during a Codecademy Learn Python for Data Science course.
## The analysis provides insights into the A/B test, offering valuable information about click-through rates, performance across social media platforms, and variations on different tech devices.
